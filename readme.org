#+TITLE: Ompholon

Not one hundred percent on the name. It conveys my intentions more or
less. navel of my fixation on Koestler's approach to a theory.

Every time I iterate on this thought experiment, I start de novo. Even a new
name. I think it helps prevent getting stuck in ruts that work, but it's
definitely not efficient.
